# Project 1: Relational Algebra

## Overview

In Project 1, we introduce how the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) represents and processes “data”. This project has 3 sections. In the first section, we will introduce SQL from an abstract perspective. In the second section (Table Codec), we discuss how to store data in the storage engine, which is TinyKV. Finally, we will explain the Relational Model (RM) and the definitions of popular SQL syntax.

## Section I
[SQL Syntax](./proj1-part1-README-en.md)

## Section II
[Table Codec](./proj1-part2-README-en.md)

## Section III
[Relational Models (RM)](./proj1-part3-README-en.md)

## Rating

Only Section II will be graded. Section I consists of coding questions from the HackerRank. Section III is for reference only.
